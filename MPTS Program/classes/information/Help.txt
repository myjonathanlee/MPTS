1. How do I open a MPTS account?

Opening a JBank & Co.com dealing account couldn't be easier. Complete the online process and then print off the application form or ask us to send it to you.

The minimum opening balance is only £100. This can be paid by cheque with your application form or by debit card on acceptance by us of your application. 


--------------------------------------------
2. How quickly are MPTS accounts set up?

Your account should be open and ready for trading on the same day that we receive your completed and signed application form. You will automatically receive an email when your account has been activated.


--------------------------------------------
3. How soon can I trade after my dealing account is opened?

You can start trading as soon as your account holds cleared funds or stock.


--------------------------------------------
4. Can non-UK residents open a dealing account?

JBank & Co accounts are only available to UK residents. You must also hold a UK bank account.

As part of the money laundering regulations introduced by the FSA, we are required to establish the address and identity of all clients.

When opening an account please provide us with one form of proof of address (eg. utility bill) and one form of proof of identity (eg. driving licence). These will be returned to you once the account has been opened. We may request further documentation if needed to activate your account.


--------------------------------------------
5. In which markets can I trade online?

Having a JBank & Co account allows you to trade in all LSE listed securities. Clients are also able to trade in investment trusts and warrants. You can now trade in blue chip International stocks at our International Trading Centre. At present Ofex stock cannot be traded at JBank & Co.


--------------------------------------------
8. How do I trade with my JBank & Co account?

Buying and selling shares with JBank & Co is simple. Just follow the few easy steps found in the instruction manual which came with your software.

Please note: 

Settlement is T+3. Overnight orders will be executed at market open on the next business day.


--------------------------------------------
9. Can I place an order outside normal trading hours?

Yes, when the market is closed you have the option to set a price limit for buying or selling your stock. This is called a Limit Order.

13. What are the charges for my online transactions?

The charges for all online transactions are currently £20 per trade.


--------------------------------------------
14. Can I obtain share certificates?

Yes, you can receive share certificates but there is a transfer out charge of £10 per security. We will need the request in writing - a fax is acceptable. As we need a client's signature we cannot accept telephone or email instruction. You can receive the share certificate in somebody else's name as long as it is stated on the request that the certificate will be registered in that name. It takes approximately 4 weeks to receive your share certificates.


--------------------------------------------
15. What documentation will I receive regarding my trading account?

Upon execution of your deal, a contract note is despatched to you on the same day of trading.  Statements of Account are sent monthly by Pershing, detailing your cash balance. Ad-hoc statements can be requested (free of charge) from info@JBankCo.com.  Statements detailing the holdings in your account are sent once a year by Pershing at the end of May. After the end of the financial year, you will receive a Consolidated Tax Certificate. 


--------------------------------------------
16. What is a nominee account?

A nominee account is where your shares are held in the account. No share certificates are issued to the client. With a nominee account there is less paperwork, shorter settlement period (T+3), and no risk of losing share certificates.

Share holdings held under a JBankCo.com account will be held in the nominee name of Pershing Keen Nominees.


--------------------------------------------
17. How secure are my online transactions and bank details?
